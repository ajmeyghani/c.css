   *  Going to need the theme color hooks:
   *   `primary`
   *   `secondary`
   *   `success`
   *   `failure`
   *   `warning`
   *   `info`
   *   `gray`
   *
   * For each color, need different variations, dark to lightest:
   *
   * primary0: dark
   * primary: base
   * primary1: 1x lighter
   * primary2: 2x lighter
   * primary3: 3x lighter
   *
   * In addition for every property, need to have the hsl values
   * defined separately for more control. For example:
   *
   * primary0-h, primary0-s, primary0-l
